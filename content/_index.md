This is where I am going to be keeping a number of smaller projects that I am simply testing out, as well as a repository of longer term projects that I want to share.



Explore the [testing grounds]({{< ref "/samples" >}}) to see what nonsense I've been up to. If you want to know more about me, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nijawi">go to my GitHub</a> or look at my [About Me Page]({{< ref "about.md" >}}) to get started.
